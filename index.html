    <h2>
      1. AKITA
    </h2>
    <p class="dog-detail">This stocky, curly-tailed Japanese mountain dog is revered in its native country as a 
      symbol of good health and long life, according to the AKC. Akitas are fiercely protective by nature,
       and in the Middle Ages, they guarded the Japanese emperor and his family.</p>
       <p class="dog-detail"> Helen Keller was gifted an Akita
        during a trip to Japan in 1937, making her the first American to own one. Akitas are very social animals,
         and they can be playful and silly. Typically, they bark only when there’s a really good reason, says the Akita
          Rescue Society of America. Akitas can be aggressive with other dogs and need to be socialized early on to interact 
          appropriately with them as well as with people.</p>

    <h2>
      2. BELIGAN MILANOIS
    </h2>
    <p class="dog-detail">Long used in police work, this dog breed achieved a moment of fame when one named Cairo helped Navy SEAL Team 6 take
      down Osama bin Laden in 2011. Another Belgian Malinois named Conan was honored in 2019 after the dog was injured during
       a raid on an ISIS leader in Iraq. Similar in appearance to the German shepherd, the Malinois is strong, intelligent, and
        loyal, making it a great choice for a guard dog.
        <br> However, it can also be territorial and jealous, according to the 
        American Belgian Malinois Club. For that reason, families should be prepared to commit a substantial amount of time to training.</p>

    <h2>
      3. BULLMASTIFF
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">Gamekeepers initially developed the loyal and brave bullmastiff to protect their game from poachers. The bullish looks of 
      this large breed can be intimidating to intruders. <br>  In actuality, this dog is naturally affectionate towards its family, making
       it an excellent companion. The bullmastiff is a born protector that needs structured training to reinforce its natural guarding 
       instincts.</P>

  <div class="text_part">
    <h2>
      4. CANE CORSO
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">This name, translated from Latin, means “bodyguard dog,” and it has been bred to be devoted to its family. 
      Also known as an Italian Mastiff, the breed is enormous, often weighing more than 100 pounds. Its short, stiff coat
       lends to its imposing appearance and indeed, the dog can be aggressive with strangers.  <br> It’s said to be impervious to pain,
        as even electric fences won’t deter it, Petful.com notes. But with its family, the cane Corso is affectionate. For these 
        reasons, it is one of the best guard dog breeds, though not for first-time dog owners. Training is imperative to prevent 
        the cane Corso from “owning” its family.</P>

    <h2>
      5. GERMAN SHEPHERD
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">A classic choice because of his imposing stature and loud bark, this German dog breed is widely seen as one of 
      the best guard dogs. Its loyalty and bravery know no bounds, and it is willing to risk its own life for that of its
       family, the AKC says. It is a natural learner and easy to train. <br> Sometimes a German shepherd can take its job a little
        too seriously, though, and needs to be taught not to pounce on anyone who approaches you or the home. These dogs do shed a
         lot and like to have a job to do, so consider that before committing to one.</P>

    <h2>
      6. DOBERMAN
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">One of the best guard dog breeds, the Doberman is a sleek, powerful, fearless, and fast dog. 
      Considered the fifth-smartest dog breed in the world, it is loyal in protecting its people and always alert. <br>
       Dobermans also bark a lot. If they need to, they will take a threat seriously, pinning an intruder against the
        wall or cornering it until humans take charge. When they’re off duty, Doberman can be big-time goofballs. <br>
         They have high energy needs and make great running companions. Unfortunately, the breed is also prone to a host of health 
         conditions, including spinal compression, blood-clotting problems, obesity, and skin issues, notes CertaPet.</P>

  <div class="text_part">
    <h2>
      7. KOMONDOR
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">The Komondor is a loving dog who needs little exercise and likes to keep its human companions in sight, 
      often following them. Intelligent with a keen instinct for protection, the Komondor's independent thought process can make this
       breed ill-suited to many.</p>
    
     <p class="dog-detail"> Komondorok (Hungarian plural komondorok) have a distinctively imposing presence, if not for their large stature and heavy musculature,
       then for their most striking feature — a tasseled white coat consisting of tight cords similar to Rastafarian dreadlocks.
      The Komondor's early foundations in the open fields, where the dog was left to make working decisions on his own for the benefit of
       the flock, is a double-edged sword in many homes today. Although the breed is intelligent and has a keen instinct for protection, 
       the Komondor's independent thought processes render this breed ill-suited to many households.

  <div class="text_part">
    <h2>
      8. RHODESIAN
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">This breed’s name comes from the distinctive ridge of fur that grows in the opposite direction of the rest of the dog’s
      coat and stands up along its spine. The AKC notes that this watchful dog was originally bred to help hunt lions, so standing 
      up to suburban threats is no big deal.  <br> They can be stubborn and domineering, and like all other guard dogs, need to be trained.
       Among family, ridgebacks are affectionate, patient, friendly, and loyal—but definitely need to be taught how to interact with
        children.</P>

    <h2>
      9. ROTTWEILER
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">Rotties, as they are known to their fans, can be sweet and playful with their families, and are very protective of them.
      To outsiders, rottweilers may appear aloof, the AKC says. The breed is actually descended from ancient mastiffs and almost
       went extinct in the late 1800s. <br> A bit smaller than their mastiff cousins, coming in at an average of about 100 pounds 
       when fully grown, Rotties can still play the intimidation card—and back it up with their bite. Because they can inflict 
       severe injury,<br> it’s imperative that rottweilers be socialized and trained early on so they understand when it is and is
        not OK to act aggressively. Training can also help prevent their barking from becoming a nuisance.</P>

  <div class="text_part">
    <h2>
      10. GREAT DANE
    </h2>
    <P class="dog-detail">This is the Scooby-Doo breed. Unlike the clumsy Scoob, however, real-life Great Danes are graceful despite their
      incredible height of about 30 inches, CanineBible.com reports. They’re also courageous and have a deep, scary-sounding
       bark—not at all like Shaggy’s best friend. <br> It’s this bark, combined with their intimidating size, that makes Great Danes 
       a good choice for a watchdog. However, just like the cartoon dog, they have affectionate, gentle personalities, and probably
        won’t actually bite an intruder. <br> Great Danes are also playful and patient with kids. They tend to have shorter lives—usually
         about six to ten years—and are prone to heart, bone, and gastrointestinal conditions.</P>
